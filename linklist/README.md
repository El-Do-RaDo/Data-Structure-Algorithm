# List
Throughout the discussion of basic data structures, we have used Python lists to implement the abstract data types presented. The list is a powerful, yet simple, collection mechanism that provides the programmer with a wide variety of operations. However, not all programming languages include a list collection. In these cases, the notion of a list must be implemented by the programmer.

## Implementing an Linked list
In order to implement an unordered list, we will construct what is commonly known as a linked list. Recall that we need to be sure that we can maintain the relative positioning of the items. However, there is no requirement that we maintain that positioning in contiguous memory. You can refer to the file list.py for further refrence.
